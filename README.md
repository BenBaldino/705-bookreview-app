### Testing Instructions:
1. To test our program, go to the "Releases" tab on the right side of this GitHub page and download the executable JAR file. 
2. Go to your command-line and cd into the directory where the JAR file is downloaded.
3. Run the following command to start up the server for our backend API.
  ```
  java -jar <filename>.jar
  ```
4. Once the server is started, you can go to our GitHub pages site in order to view an interactable frontend to test the endpoints and the database running on the server.
